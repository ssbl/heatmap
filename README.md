(`ls` with fancy colors)

The current idea is to list all files in a directory, and use
different colors to distinguish recently modified files from older
files. So my files untouched since 2014 will be displayed in blue,
while files I edited yesterday will appear red.

other ideas
-----------

* work on specific files instead of all of them
* add an option to ignore some files
* use other parameters such as file size
* use git-related parameters
